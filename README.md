# Flapless

*A flightless bird, a canyon full of dangers, and just enough balloons to make bad decisions.*

**Flapless** is a chaotic arcade roguelike where you play as a determined, balloon-powered bird navigating a deadly vertical canyon. Inspired by NES classics like *Balloon Fight*, but with modern progression and physics-based madness.
